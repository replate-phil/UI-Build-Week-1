          Don't fiddle with it all day. Use what you see, don't plan it. Once
          you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become
          a tiger. With practice comes confidence.

          Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight.
          Not every limb is perfect. You can spend all day playing with
          mountains. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium
          white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson,
          Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. We'll do another happy
          little painting. That's crazy.

            La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. It's life. It's interesting.
            It's fun. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your
            entire perspective. You can't have light without dark. You can't
            know happiness unless you've known sorrow.

            We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our
            imagination. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing
            here. Poor old tree. It is a lot of fun.

            At home you have unlimited time. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give
            him a little friend. It's so important to do something every day
            that will make you happy. Let's put some happy little clouds in our
            world.
